                              <div class="post-content"><p>I work as a babysitter and skating coach to afford my school student activity fees, the cost of participating in social life and extracurricular activities with my friends, field trips, tickets to sporting events, and personal care items.</p>
                                <p>Teaching figure skating to kids with disabilities has been a privilege, but also a challenge. The first girl I taught was seven years old, with a condition making it difficult for her to speak and focus. On our first day, I was flooded with nervous emotions, not because I didn't know what to teach, but because I didn't know how. I didn't anticipate the immense adjustments I would need to make to keep this child happy and comfortable. Our first forty minutes together consisted of me talking and moving, while she stared at me. Although I spent my whole life in a figure skating rink, the skating I was taught was not what I needed now.</p>
                                <p>For our second lesson, I tried a new teaching method with a new form of communication. Instead of talking her through the steps, I would physically help her do it. Using one hand to grasp hers gently, I used my other hand to push her feet forward. Slowly, we began to move. A lap around the rink was arduous, but it was a big step for us. After that lesson, she got off the ice with a massive smile on her face. This smile felt rewarding to me and showed I was doing something right. This new physical way of communicating, which involves using gestures instead of words, was something I learned worked better for her specifically. Some of the other kids demonstrated an opposite experience, where being touched caused them to feel uncomfortable and react negatively. This led me to learn to adjust to create positive outcomes. As long as the kids were safe, I could use trial and error to discover the ideal way of communicating for each student's needs.</p>
                                <p>This experience also helped me improve my communication skills in other areas of my life. From teaching Adaptive Skating, I learned that different people need different strategies to succeed, and so do I. I have applied the skills I learned from teaching skating to children with disabilities to my daily interactions, such as working in groups at school, giving academic presentations, and my babysitting job. My newfound ability to adapt my communication to specific audiences or the needs of the situation has helped me grow as a person. I never thought a seven-year-old could teach me so much!</p></div>
